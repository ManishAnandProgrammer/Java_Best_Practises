Approach_01:
    *   The main advantage of the public field approach is that the API makes it clear
        that the class is a singleton: the public static field is final, so it will always contain
        the same object reference.
    *   The second advantage is that itâ€™s simpler.

Approach_02:
    *   One advantage of the static factory approach is that it gives you the flexibility
        to change your mind about whether the class is a singleton without changing its
        API. The factory method returns the sole instance, but it could be modified to
        return, say, a separate instance for each thread that invokes it.
